# Optimizing TinyML with quantization and distillation for Indoor Localisation in Resource-Constrained Environments

In this project we try to deploy a feasible adaptation
of state-of-the-art TinyML indoor localization systems for usage
in third-world countries with minimal components, resources,
and computer infrastructure. High-performance hardware employed in current research, such as wearables and complex
microcontrollers, is either unavailable or excessively expensive in
these circumstances. Our approach tackles this by maintaining
functional equivalence while replacing costly components with
widely available, reasonably priced microcontrollers, such the
ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico. The lightweight Transformer and
Mamba versions are designed to fit inside the rigorous 32â€“64 KB
RAM constraints that are typical of low-cost microcontrollers
using quantization and information distillation. By providing
accurate on-device indoor localization for smart home and
healthcare applications with minimal energy and infrastructure
requirements, the proposed architecture contributes to the democratization of advanced TinyML technologies for developing
nations.
